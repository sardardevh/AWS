End-to-End CI/CD Process Using AWS Services
This example demonstrates creating a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy. The pipeline automates code deployment for an application hosted on EC2 instances.

Step 1: Prerequisites
AWS Account: Ensure you have access to an AWS account with appropriate permissions.
IAM Role Configuration: Create IAM roles with required permissions for each service:
CodePipeline Role: Access to CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and S3.
CodeBuild Role: Access to build artifacts and logs.
CodeDeploy Role: Access to deploy applications on target instances.
EC2 Instances: Set up EC2 instances with the application environment (e.g., Apache for a web app).
Install the CodeDeploy Agent on these instances.
Step 2: Create a Code Repository in CodeCommit
Open the AWS Management Console and go to CodeCommit.
Create a repository for your application code (e.g., MyAppRepo).
Clone the repository to your local machine and push your application code:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://git-codecommit.<region>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MyAppRepo
cd MyAppRepo
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
Step 3: Set Up Build Automation with CodeBuild
Go to CodeBuild in the AWS Console.
Create a build project:
Source: Select CodeCommit and choose your repository.
Environment: Choose a managed image (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 with Node.js/Java/etc.).
Buildspec File: Use a buildspec.yml file in your repository or define inline.
Example buildspec.yml:
yaml
Copy code
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies...
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building the application...
      - npm run build
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
Save the project.
Step 4: Configure CodeDeploy for Deployment
Open CodeDeploy and create an application:
Application name: MyAppDeployment.
Compute platform: EC2/On-premises.
Create a deployment group:
Deployment type: Choose In-place deployment or Blue/Green deployment.
Attach your EC2 instances to the group using tags or instance IDs.
Specify the IAM role for CodeDeploy.
Add an appspec.yml file to your repository to define the deployment process:
yaml
Copy code
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /var/www/html
hooks:
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/before_install.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/after_install.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
Step 5: Set Up CodePipeline
Open CodePipeline in the AWS Console and create a pipeline:
Source Stage: Select CodeCommit as the source provider, and choose your repository and branch.
Build Stage: Add CodeBuild as the build provider, and select your build project.
Deploy Stage: Use CodeDeploy as the deploy provider, and choose the application and deployment group created earlier.
Review and create the pipeline.
Step 6: Test the CI/CD Pipeline
Make changes to your code and push them to the CodeCommit repository:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Updated application"
git push origin main
The pipeline is automatically triggered:
Source Stage: Fetches the latest code from CodeCommit.
Build Stage: Builds the code and prepares artifacts using CodeBuild.
Deploy Stage: Deploys the application to EC2 instances using CodeDeploy.
Step 7: Monitor and Optimize
Monitoring:
Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to view build and deployment logs.
Use CodePipeline console to track the progress of each stage.
Optimize:
Add approval actions for manual interventions.
Integrate tests (e.g., unit tests, load tests) in the build phase.
Use notifications (e.g., Amazon SNS) for pipeline events.
