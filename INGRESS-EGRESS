Ingress ================================

Ingress refers to incoming traffic to a system, network, or application. It is the traffic initiated from an external source and directed towards your infrastructure or resources, such as web requests to a web server, or data being sent to a storage bucket.

Example: A user accessing a website hosted on a server.
Ingress rules: In networking, ingress rules define what kind of traffic is allowed to enter a system, such as IP ranges, protocols, or ports.

Egress ===================================

Egress refers to outgoing traffic from a system, network, or application. It is the traffic that originates from your infrastructure or resources and goes towards an external system or destination.

Example: A server sending an API request to a third-party service.
Egress rules: These define what kind of traffic is allowed to leave a system, such as protocols, destination IPs, or ports.
Key Differences
Aspect	Ingress	Egress
Direction	Traffic entering a system.	Traffic leaving a system.
Initiator	External entity (e.g., client).	Internal entity (e.g., server).
Use case	Managing access to resources.	Controlling outbound communication.
Firewall Rules	Ingress rules allow incoming traffic.	Egress rules allow outgoing traffic.
Examples	HTTP requests to a web server.	Database queries to an external system.
Real-Life Example in AWS
Ingress: An AWS Security Group rule allowing HTTP (port 80) traffic from the internet to an EC2 instance.
Egress: An AWS Security Group rule allowing an EC2 instance to access an external API or database over HTTPS (port 443).
